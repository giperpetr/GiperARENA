# Description: Implement game session lifecycle management with real-time WebSocket communication
# Details:
Create game session API endpoints for session lifecycle (create, join, leave, start, end). Implement session queue system for popular arenas with wait time estimates. Build session state machine (waiting → in_progress → completed → cancelled) with proper validation. Create real-time Socket.io integration for live session updates. Build game lobby UI with player list, ready status, and chat functionality. Implement session countdown timer and ready check system.

# Test Strategy:
Test session lifecycle operations, verify real-time updates work correctly, validate queue system functionality, test lobby interactions and chat
