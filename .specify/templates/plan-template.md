**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Verify compliance with ArenaHUB Constitution v1.0.0:

### I. Technology Stack Compliance
- [ ] Using Supabase (PostgreSQL 17, Auth, Realtime, Storage)?
- [ ] Using approved frontend stack (Next.js 14+, React Native with TypeScript)?
- [ ] Using Redis for caching real-time data?
- [ ] Blockchain integration via Solana (if financial features)?
- [ ] State management via Zustand or Redux Toolkit?

### II. Architecture Principles Compliance
- [ ] Microservices with clear bounded contexts?
- [ ] API-First: REST/GraphQL endpoints documented before UI?
- [ ] Event-driven architecture for real-time features?
- [ ] Blockchain-first for ALL financial operations?
- [ ] Horizontal scalability supported?

### III. Quality Standards Compliance
- [ ] Test coverage plan achieves 80% for critical modules?
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode enabled?
- [ ] ESLint + Prettier configured?
- [ ] Code review process defined?

- [ ] Rate limiting implemented for all public endpoints?
- [ ] Sensitive data encryption plan (AES-256, TLS 1.3)?
- [ ] Smart contract security audit planned (if blockchain)?
- [ ] GDPR compliance addressed?

### V. Performance Standards Compliance
- [ ] API p95 response time <200ms target?
- [ ] WebRTC latency <100ms target (if applicable)?
- [ ] System supports 10,000+ concurrent users?
- [ ] Mobile network (3G/4G) optimization planned?

### VI. User Experience Compliance
- [ ] Mobile-first design approach?
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance?
- [ ] Multilingual support (minimum 5 languages)?
- [ ] Offline-first for critical functions?
- [ ] Progressive loading implemented?

### VII. Blockchain Compliance (if applicable)
- [ ] Financial operations via smart contracts only?
- [ ] Blockchain explorer transparency provided?
- [ ] DAO governance integration planned?
- [ ] NFTs for digital assets?
- [ ] Multi-signature for critical operations?

### VIII. Documentation Compliance

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
